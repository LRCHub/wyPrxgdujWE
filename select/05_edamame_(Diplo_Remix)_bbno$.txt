Whoa
Whoa
Balls hangin' low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swangin', cling clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Badass B, keep on goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (yeah, ay)
That's a lot, whoa
Yeah, hit the spot, whoa
That's a lot, whoa
Just popped a kidney, I bought a million options of the stock
And I stopped doin' the green
Man, I rock arenas, bringin' the peace and I'm bumpin' that Pac
In the car, pretendin' I got all the eyes on me
Got a bad baby and she's independent
Too many people older than me that's seekin' attention
When they warned me 'bout the goofies, man I shoulda listened
And the smell of the money my strangest addiction, uh
Balls hangin' low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swangin', cling clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Badass B, keep on goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (yeah, ay)
That's a lot, whoa
Yeah, hit the spot, whoa
That's a lot, whoa
I don't ever really wanna talk, talk, talk, talk
Only really ever want the top, top, top, top
Guess I'm goin' back to the sock, sock, sock, sock
Least this money never really stop, stop, stop, stop
Hey little mamma, yeah, you heard about me?
I'ma pop you like a pea, yeah, edamame
Yeah, I feel so hot like I'm chillin' on the beach
Yeah, baby in the sun like the Teletubbies
Balls hangin' low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swangin', cling clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Badass B, keep on goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (yeah, ay)
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (yeah, ay)
(Whoa)
Whoa
(Whoa)
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (yeah, ay)
(Whoa)
