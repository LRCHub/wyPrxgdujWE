Balls hanging low while I pop a
bottle off a yacht
Chain swanging, cling-clang and
it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala,
yeah, and you are not
Bad-ass B, keep on going 'til
you hit the spot
Woah, I'm a big bag hunter with
the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop
it low
Mama called me and she happy
with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie,
that's an oath (Yeah, ayy)
Just popped her kidney, I bought
a million
Options of the stock and I
stopped doin' the green
Man, I rock arenas, bringin' the
peace, I'm bumpin' that Pac
In the car, pretendin' I got all
the eyes on me
Got a bad baby and she's
independent
So many people older than me
that's seekin' attention
When they warned me 'bout the
goofies, man, I shoulda
listened
And the smell of the money my
strangest addiction, uh
She tip for dick, I let her lick
I had to dip, I'm off a fifth,
am I rich now?
I bought a whip, I paint it pink
It drive itself, the fuck you
think? Yeah, I'm rich now
Ayy lil' mama, yeah, you heard
about me
I'ma pop you like a pea, yeah,
edamame
Yeah, feel so hot like I'm
chillin' on the beach
Yeah, baby in the sun like the
Teletubbies (Woo)
Balls hanging low while I pop a
bottle off a yacht

Never ever fold for a thottie,

I've been in the club and takin'
shots
If you got your mask off in the
photo you getting cropped
Hoppin' out the function, the
CVS is like a block away
Bought a moisturizer, my ice
cold, it's drying my face
Don't need that VVS, my ice is
fake, your life is fake
I choose to do it for my
pocket's sake
You basing your opinions on what
the major says
I renovate, the bad energy I
erase, uh
Yeah, I don't ever really wanna
talk, talk, talk, talk
Only really ever want the top,
top, top, top
Guess I'm goin' back to the
sock, sock, sock, sock
Least this money never really
stop, stop, stop, stop
Ayy lil' mama, yeah, you heard
about me
